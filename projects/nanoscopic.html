        <h2 class="article-subtitle">The Open Web Platform</h2>
        <p>
            The Nanoscopic Platform is intended to be a simple and easy
            to use alternative to WordPress. It uses the Django web framework
            which is a mature and well documented framework allowing new
            developers to easily learn what is required when it comes to
            developing for the Nanoscopic Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            The platform will also provide an easy to use plugin and
            addon store so that users can install already made updates to
            their websites quickly and easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore the platform will be open source and free to use
            with the MIT license which is extremely permissive and allows
            for just about any modification you could want to make. The
            MIT license can be found here:
            <a href="https://mit-license.org/">MIT license</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to what was mentioned above if you already have
            a Django website you'll be able to add the different parts of
            the Nanoscopic platform which you want and leave out the parts
            you don't want.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are other features planned but they won't be listed
            here until it is clear they will be completed on time and
            as promised.
