        <p>
            Bhyve Cloud (as the name suggests) is going to be a cloud
            based platform on *BSD operting systems. This will allow
            people to deploy projects to a cloud provider that has
            experience with working with *BSD systems and also have
            access to specialised technical supoort.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be noted though that development is going to take
            time so don't expect to see anything for a while.
