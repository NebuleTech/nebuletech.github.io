        <h2 class="article-subtitle">What Are We Working On?</h2>
        <p>
            Nebule Tech is a small company working to create useful
            open source software for people whilst also providing
            commercial technical support so that users can feel confident
            that no matter what happens their IT systems are safe and secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only that but we also provide web hosting for all of our
            products so you don't have to worry about anything at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our primary project at the moment is the Nanoscopic Platform.
            It is intented to be a WordPress alternative with the
            difference being a more liberal open source license and a
            codebase that is easy to use even for a novice.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to keep up to date with what we're doing then
            have a look at our <a href="../projects/index.html">projects page</a>
            which will be kept up to date with as much information as possible.
